This was written by me to brute force the key used in Gm E38 ecu's using a GM MDI
This could take up to 7 days of running to find the key
I did use example code and dll from https://github.com/BrianHumlicek.
Hopefully I did include the correct copywrite information in the code and also here..
Let me know of any issues, I am new at this, might be able to fix it, but might not.. I will try..
